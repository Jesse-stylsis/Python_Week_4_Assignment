# Python_Week_4_Assignment
# File Read & Write Challenge with Error Handling

This Python program reads the content of an input file, modifies it (converts it to uppercase in this case), and writes the modified content to an output file. The program includes error handling to ensure smooth execution even if there are issues like missing files or read/write errors.

## Features

- Read content from an input file.
- Modify the content (convert it to uppercase).
- Write the modified content to an output file.
- Gracefully handle errors such as:
  - File not found.
  - Read/write permission issues.
  - Unexpected errors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12 or any version

## How to Use

1. Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed. You can download it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
2. Download or clone the repository containing the Python script.

3. Save the provided Python code in a file, e.g., `file_read_write.py`.

4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the Python file is saved.

5. Run the program by executing:

   ```bash
   python file_read_write.py
   
6. The program will prompt you to enter:
- **Input filename**: The name of the file to read from.
- **Output filename**: The name of the file to write the modified content to.
7. The program will process the input file, modify the content (convert it to uppercase), and write it to the output file. If any errors occur, a descriptive error message will be shown.
